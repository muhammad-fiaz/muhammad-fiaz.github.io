Logging is foundational to systems programming. In the Zig ecosystem, which is still maturing, there exists a need for robust, standardized tooling. **Logly** is a new logging library designed to fill this gap, prioritizing performance, modularity, and thread safety.

## Design Philosophy

Logly was built with three core principles:

1.  **Zero Allocation on Hot Path**: Logging should not trigger the memory allocator during standard operations unless strictly necessary (e.g., formatting dynamic strings).
2.  **Modularity**: The core logger is decoupled from the output destination (Sink).
3.  **Ergonomics**: The API should be intuitive for developers coming from other modern languages.

## Key Features

### Modular Sinks

Logly supports multiple output targets simultaneously.

- **ConsoleSink**: Thread-safe standard output logging.
- **FileSink**: Rotating file logs with configurable size and time policies.
- **NetworkSink** (Planned): Asynchronous logging to remote aggregators.

### Thread Safety

All sinks are thread-safe by default, utilizing efficient synchronization primitives (mutexes/atomics) to ensure data integrity in concurrent applications without blocking the main execution thread significantly.

### Rich Formatting

Support for structured logging (JSON) and customizable text formats allows integration with observability platforms like Datadog, Grafana Loki, or simple terminal viewing.

## Benchmarks

Preliminary benchmarks against standard writing methods show minimal overhead.

```
Benchmark: 1,000,000 log entries
Hardware: Apple M2 Pro

Implementation | Time (ms) | Ops/sec
-------------- | --------- | -----------
std.debug.print| 450ms     | ~2.2M
Logly (Buffered)| 120ms     | ~8.3M
```

_Note: Benchmarks are synthetic and dependent on I/O buffering strategies._

## Getting Started

Logly is available via the Zig package manager.

```zig
// build.zig.zon
.{
    .dependencies = .{
        .logly = .{
            .url = "https://github.com/muhammad-fiaz/logly/archive/v0.1.0.tar.gz",
            .hash = "..."
        },
    },
}
```

Usage in your application:

```zig
const logly = @import("logly");

pub fn main() !void {
    var logger = try logly.init(.{ .level = .info });
    defer logger.deinit();

    try logger.info("Server started on port {d}", .{8080});
}
```

## Roadmap

The project is currently in v0.1.0. Future development will focus on asynchronous logging capabilities, compression for file sinks, and deeper integration with the Zig standard library's `std.log` interface.
