As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into production workflows, the ability to elicit reliable, structured responses—Prompt Engineering—has become a specialized technical skill. It is not merely about asking questions; it is about constraining the model's probabilistic nature to achieve deterministic results.

## Core Techniques

### 1. Few-Shot Prompting

Providing examples (shots) within the prompt significantly improves performance by conditioning the model on the expected input-output pattern.

**Non-Optimal (Zero-Shot):**

> Classify the sentiment: "The product is decent."

**Optimal (Few-Shot):**

> Classify the sentiment as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.
> Input: "I love this." -> Sentiment: Positive
> Input: "This is terrible." -> Sentiment: Negative
> Input: "The product is decent." -> Sentiment:

### 2. Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

For complex reasoning tasks, instructing the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps reduces logic errors.

> "Think step-by-step. First, analyze the user's constraints. Second, calculate the total cost. Finally, provide the recommendation."

### 3. System Prompts and Personas

Establishing a robust system prompt sets the boundary conditions for the interaction.

```text
System: You are a strict code reviewer. You analyze Python code for PEP8 compliance
and potential security vulnerabilities. You output ONLY the list of issues in JSON format.
Do not provide conversational filler.
```

## Structural Constraints

In automated systems, parsing unstructured text is a point of failure. Modern models utilize grammar-based constraints to enforce output schemas.

- **JSON Mode**: Forces the model to output valid JSON.
- **Function Calling**: Forces the model to output arguments matching a specific function signature.

## Iterative Refinement

Prompt engineering is an empirical process. Evaluation requires:

1.  **Test Sets**: A diverse collection of inputs with known "gold standard" outputs.
2.  **Metrics**: Automated scoring (using a stronger LLM as a judge) to verify correctness and adherence to instructions.

## Conclusion

Effective prompt engineering shifts the workload from the user to the system definition. By combining few-shot examples, reasoning chains, and strict output schemas, developers can build robust applications on top of probabilistic models.
