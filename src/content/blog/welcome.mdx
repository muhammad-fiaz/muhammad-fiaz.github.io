This platform serves as a knowledge repository for my work in software engineering, specifically focusing on the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and high-performance systems.

## Primary Themes

### 1. AI Engineering & MLOps

Moving beyond the "demo" phase of AI. I write about architecture patterns for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), fine-tuning methodology, and the infrastructure required to serve Large Language Models at scale.

### 2. Systems Programming

Exploring the lower levels of the stack. Expect deep dives into **Zig** and **Rust**, memory management strategies, and compiler optimization. The goal is to understand how software interacts with hardware to achieve maximum efficiency.

### 3. Open Source Development

I am an active contributor to the open-source community. This blog will document the development of my tools (such as **Logly**), sharing design decisions, release notes, and lessons learned from maintaining public repositories.

## Purpose

The content here is written for engineers who care about _how_ things work. My aim is to provide dense, actionable technical content—benchmarks, code analysis, and architectural critiques—rather than high-level speculation.

Thank you for reading.
