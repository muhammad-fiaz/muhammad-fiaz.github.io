Last updated: December 28, 2025

## Acceptance of Terms

Welcome to the website of Muhammad Fiaz or any organisation related to me like Fiaz Technologies ("we," "our," or "us"). By accessing and using this website, you accept and agree to be bound by the terms and provision of this agreement. If you do not agree to abide by the above, please do not use this service.

## Use License

Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials on Muhammad Fiaz's website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:

- Modify or copy the materials
- Use the materials for any commercial purpose or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial)
- Attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on the website
- Remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials

This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by us at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.

## Disclaimer

The materials on Muhammad Fiaz's website are provided on an 'as is' basis. Muhammad Fiaz makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.

Further, Muhammad Fiaz does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials on its website or otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites linked to this site.

## Limitations

In no event shall Muhammad Fiaz or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on Muhammad Fiaz's website, even if Muhammad Fiaz or a Muhammad Fiaz authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.

The materials appearing on Muhammad Fiaz's website could include technical, typographical, or photographic errors. Muhammad Fiaz does not warrant that any of the materials on its website are accurate, complete, or current.

## Links

Muhammad Fiaz has not reviewed all of the sites linked to its website and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by Muhammad Fiaz of the site. Use of any such linked website is at the user's own risk.

## Modifications
